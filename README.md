# Caesar's Cipher

### Problem Description
Use frequency analysis to break Caesarâ€™s Cypher. This is a brute force method that tests all the possible displacements and returns the most likely decryption of a text. Frequency analysis relies on the fact that some letters (or combination of letters ) occur more in a language, regardless of the text size. For example, in English the letters E, A are the most frequent,while the Z and Q are the least frequent.
